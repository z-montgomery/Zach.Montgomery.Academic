# Biography
I am Religious Studies scholar interested in the limits of religious expression in the United States of America. I am most interested in the exchange of concepts, symbols, and practices that occur between the boundaries of various minority religious traditions and mainstream American culture.
  
My current project focuses on contemporary Pagan and occult communities and how they construct, maintain, and experience their religious identities in the U.S.
