# Biography
I am Religious Studies scholar interested in the limits of religious expression in the United States of America. I am most interested in the exchange of concepts, symbols, and practices that occur between the boundaries of various minority religious traditions and mainstream American culture.   
  
When two sets of ideas conflict with one another, they engage in a culture war for the "proper" definition (and implications) of a concept. Sometimes these ideas are fully incorporated into the larger culture (such as the widespread acceptance of yoga and other "Eastern" religions in the United States or the use of tantra by English occultist Aleister Crowley), while other concepts or symbols remain open for debate. In either case, the ideas change: whether that be through the production of specific limitations on their expression or a "redrawing" of the battlelines. I use comparative methodologies, fieldwork, participant observation, and other ethnographic methods to analyze those changes.  
  
My current project focuses on contemporary Pagan and occult communities and how they construct, maintain, and experience their religious identities, their religious boundaries, in the U.S.
