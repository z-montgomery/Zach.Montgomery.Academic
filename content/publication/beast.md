The _Ordo Templi Orientis_, or OTO, grew in prominence through the writings and marketing of English occultist Alesiter Crowley at the beginning of the 20th century. Crowley's journals, which detail his magical practices, rituals, and theories, are still used in the instruction and guidance for new magicians. The journals demonstrate a deeply rooted misogony which envision women and female bodies around which "magick" occurs. Crowley's orignal vision, however, is at odds with the current demographic information of contemporary occult communities which are mostly female. This new generationg of occultists frequently employ feminist theory to reread and recontextualize Crowley's writings where Thelema is now a liberatory philosophy for women which challenges patriarchical norms.  
  
Current methods of studying the contemporary OTO and other occult communities disfavor ethnographic approaches, relying instead on the material productions (books, journals, pamphlets, etc.). This, unfortunately, has the effect of favoring male writers and bodies since, for most of the early 20th century, magick emphasized the role of the male occultist. The writings of female occultists were preserved if they possessed close ties to the established male occultists. Because of this, the gradual shifting and recontextualization experienced in the field goes unnoticed and unrecorded by academics. I argue, therefore, that there is an increased need for ethnographic fieldwork within those communities to understand how these changes are occurring at both the individual and communal levels."""
